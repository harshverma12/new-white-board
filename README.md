# Draw It!

## Description
**Draw It** is a web programming project made with `Node.js` on the server side and plain `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS` on the client side.

The application uses `socket.io` for real time chat communication. All data is saved in a `MongoDB` database in the cloud (using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and `mongoose` for database access).

**App features include**:
* User account management system with registration and modification of data on request
* Password encryption with `bcrypt`
* Error handling with client-side message boxes
* Session management for detecting invalid access to resources
* Real-time chat with customizable username colors
* User statistics like the number of messages sent
* Real-time collaborative drawing board
* Support for touch screen drawing
* Ability to create/delete rooms and set a maximum amount of members
* Ability to search rooms by name
